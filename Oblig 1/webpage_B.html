    <h1>Students in the group</h1>
    <h2> Mikael Sommervold, student number: 386092</h2>
    <p>My former school is NTNU and while I technically studied at the Kalvskinnet campus most of my lectures were held in the buildings belonging to the NTNU University Museum, not the campus itself.</p>
    <h2>Cecilia Nguyen, student number: 313104 </h2>
    <p>My former school is Vågsbygd VGS, where I studied general studies, it was a very nice school. </p>
    <h2>Megerditch Chadoyan, student number: 385399</h2>
    <p>At my former school, I used to have the same spot at the reading hall throughout the year. It was perfectly positioned in the corner next by the window. I wonder if I may find something similar here at OsloMet.</p>
    <h2>Mustafa Al-Amiri, student number: 374984</h2>
    <p>I went to Foss vgs and studied a bit of IT before I came here to OsloMet. In the cellar of the building, there were music rooms, since the school is meant for music students.</p>
    <h2>Sunniva Sørensen, student number: 386099</h2>
    <p>At my highschool NRK once made an episode of Folkeopplysningen trying to influence the student election. They called it a success but the numbers said something else. The episode is now flagged for breach of good press practice.</p>
