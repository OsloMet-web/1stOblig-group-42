    <h1>Students in the group</h1>
    <h2> Mikael Sommervold, studentnumber: 386092</h2>
    <p>My former school is NTNU and while I technically studied at the Kalvskinnet campus most of my lectures were held in the buildings belonging to the NTNU University Museum, not the campus itself.</p>
    <h2>Cecilia Nguyen, studentnumber: 313104 </h2>
    <p>My former school is Vågsbygd VGS, where I studied general studies, it was a very nice school. </p>
    <h2>Megerditch Chadoyan, studentnummer: 385399</h2>
    <p>At my former school, I used to have the same spot at the reading hall throughout the year. It was perfectly positioned in the corner next by the window. I wonder if I may find something similar here at OsloMet.</p>
